After almost two hours of playing with GitHub Actions and hugo config files, 
I managed to host my blog on GitHub pages appropriately.

They made it so easy, I just used a project called hugo to build the very thing you are looking at, for free.

I am also hosting this website for free, it is static and allows no user interactions yes, but it meets my needs, and is free.

Someone told us in a group chat meeting a long time ago that, in any business, there will emerge a ~~bloody asshole~~ blessed man who demonetizes the industry, and gives services to all of their customers for free.

Well good for them! As long as I share in the benefits, well, they are good people.

Thank you, GitHub! (*Please let me use curse words in my blog*)

And, Thank you, Hugo! (*Sincerely*,*No strings attached*)
