My dog just bit me. It hurt, but not that much. 
I am really indifferent to this incident. 
My friend and his dog were here some time ago, 
and they were playing with her favorite balls. 
I tried to grab my dog and move her away from them, 
but she bit me.

My project is advancing really well. 
I have been a freelancer for almost all of my working years,
and one thing I've noticed is that it is really detrimental 
to my personal growth. 

In the sense that my cognitive abilities get spread thin 
along various projects in the span of a year. However, 
if I am working on only one project, my rationale, 
consciousness, and subconscious will focus on solving 
that one problem, and this will surely concentrate 
all of my inner forces on solving it, which in turn 
results in much more productivity and efficiency.

Whenever I am in a state of concentration on anything, 
new ideas and brilliant strategies emerge so effortlessly 
in my intellect.

To a degree in which I will be thinking of it even 
while sleeping, that after waking up in the middle 
of the night like any other night, I find myself still 
concentrating on that idea, and resuming my dream afterward.

I named this experience of mine "Beast mode". 
Since I remind myself of hungry beasts, with their eyes 
locked on their target, seeing nothing else, 
hearing nothing else, LOCKED IN.
