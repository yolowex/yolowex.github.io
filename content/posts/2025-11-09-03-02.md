I have a small ring for my pinky finger. It is made of cheap black plastic.
However, it holds a special meaning for me because, at the time when I bought it, I was very alone and distressed.

I bought it when I didn't have to, when I hardly had any money or support, when I was alone in a wild city far away from my hometown, where nobody cared for me, even insincerely.

That ring is special to me because it symbolizes something deep within me, something unknown and mysterious. My ring precisely resembles that *"something"*; Dark and promising.

I don't know where I put it though! after relocating my house every single fucking thing I need is not there, I haven't looked for the ring but my peanut butter? **MY DOG'S FUCKING SHAMPOO**? Where the fuck have I put them?
