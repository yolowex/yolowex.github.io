I remember when I was kid, when I was at most 15 years old, I created a weblog for myself.
I was so hyped over it, I was thinking, *I'm going to get so many viewers...*

And I didn't.

Past-me would condemn me for not achieving that, but Present-me doesn't even care, really, not in the slightest.

It is really weird how people change over the course of time, people can change so much, that they can become the opposite of what they once were.

Anyway, I am not much of a literature person, I would be if I was a wordsmith, but I'm not yet. 

I am going to host this blog on GitHub pages now.
