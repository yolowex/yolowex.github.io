I think I am becoming much better at my new routine, which includes reading books, listening to podcasts, and conversing with native English speakers.

It is a habit of mine to come up with a solution for solving multiple problems. I am used to killing multiple birds with only one stone; hell, as long as I am locked in, even half a stone is enough.

If I had to make an example, I would narrate to you my life. But let us not go down that road.

Imagine your goal is to reach place X, but before you get there, you also have to fetch an item from shop Y, which happens to be not on the route to place X. So, to solve this problem, you will naturally go to shop Y first, and then head to place X. 

That would be the case if you weren't an overly experienced taxi driver, knowing every alleyway in the city like all the cavities of his underrated wife. 

An inexperienced mind might think, "*But isn't the shortest path between two points a straight line?*"

Of course it is, nevertheless, you are missing the point. Think differently. Step out of that paradigm of weak imaginations.
