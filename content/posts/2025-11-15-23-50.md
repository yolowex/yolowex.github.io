I created a GitHub organization! 
And I got a really good name too. Awesome Open Source Projects.
Fantastic.
I am starting to work on my open-source idea—specifically, the project that aims to provide more reliable data for LLMs to train on.
In my opinion, it is an excellent project. It helps to advance AI—humans deliberately teaching AI.
I can't do this alone. I should find some partners, as the core contributors of the community. People whom I know are proficient and can help with the project. 
I should search for them. After I find them, I will send an invitation email to each of them and discuss the matter with them over voice chat to ensure they are trustworthy and serious about it.
There are two problems here. 
First, I will email many people. I estimate I have to email at least 100 people to find the core contributors. Therefore, my email address may likely be flagged as spam. I should avoid that.
Additionally, a significant amount of scamming has occurred over the past few years, primarily through email. So I should make sure that I do not seem to them as one.
I should devise some measures to prevent these problems.
