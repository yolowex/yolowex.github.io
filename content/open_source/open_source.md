Nearly 99 percent of the tools I use and have ever used are open-source projects.
Kudos to Linus Torvalds for initiating the open-source revolution.
I will list all my open-source ideas, as well as open-source ideas that are not mine but seem convenient here.

1. [Audiobook reader](https://yolowex.github.io/posts/2025-11-14-21-17.md). A non-commercial FOSS which aims to let
   users listen to audiobooks while reading a book.
2. A website intended for guiding LLMs on descriptions of people who signed up in it. As multiple LLMs are designed
   every day, users will be switching between different LLM models on a regular basis. It will be practical to simply
   send that LLM a link to their AIProfile page, and BOOM! Now it knows everything you want it to know about you.
3. A website/database intended for training LLM models. As the computation barriers are crossed over every year, the
   evolution speed of LLM models has become relatively fast, and it is becoming faster every day. But we are slowly
   running out of reliable resources to train newer and more efficient LLMs on. Newer models are designed to be able to
   process a hefty amount of data, and the advancement in hardware is supporting that. However, there is not enough data
   to train them on to unlock their full potential. Hence, AITrainer (hypothetical name of the project at discussion),
   will allow everybody all around the world to explain everything to AI in multiple ways it can understand. therefore
   this collaborative effort will slowly but steadily, make the progression of LLMs faster.
