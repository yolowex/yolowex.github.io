      <description>&lt;p&gt;My dog just bit me. It hurt, but not that much.
I am really indifferent to this incident.
My friend and his dog were here some time ago,
and they were playing with her favorite balls.
I tried to grab my dog and move her away from them,
but she bit me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My project is advancing really well.
I have been a freelancer for almost all of my working years,
and one thing I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed is that it is really detrimental
to my personal growth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Locking in</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I think I am becoming much better at my new routine, which includes reading books, listening to podcasts, and conversing with native English speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a habit of mine to come up with a solution for solving multiple problems. I am used to killing multiple birds with only one stone; hell, as long as I am locked in, even half a stone is enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had to make an example, I would narrate to you my life. But let us not go down that road.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A purely Machiavellian day</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My dog just stole my underwear, not the one that is on me,
she grabbed it from somewhere in the house. Since I am not a tidy person, anything can be found anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend, who happens to be my neighbor, came by two hours ago,
we talked for an hour and a half, about our problems, ambitions, life plans and past dramas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoy my conversations with him very much. He is not the only person whom I openly discuss my Machiavellian ideas with,
but he is the only one who understands my schemes and the reasons behind them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Testing github actions</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After almost two hours of playing with GitHub Actions and hugo config files,
I managed to host my blog on GitHub pages appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They made it so easy, I just used a project called hugo to build the very thing you are looking at, for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also hosting this website for free, it is static and allows no user interactions yes, but it meets my needs, and is free.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My very first post</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I remember when I was kid , when I was at most 15 years old, I created a weblog for myself.
I was so hyped over it, I was thinking, &lt;em&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to get so many viewers&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I didn&amp;rsquo;t. 🐏&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past-me would condemn me for not achieving that, but Present-me doesn&amp;rsquo;t even care, really, not in the slightest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is really weird how people change over the course of time, people can change so much, that they can become the opposite of what they once were.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
