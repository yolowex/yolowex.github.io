      <description>&lt;p&gt;I remember when I was kid, when I was at most 15 years old, I created a weblog for myself.
I was so hyped over it, I was thinking, &lt;em&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to get so many viewers&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I didn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past-me would condemn me for not achieving that, but Present-me doesn&amp;rsquo;t even care, really, not in the slightest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is really weird how people change over the course of time, people can change so much, that they can become the opposite of what they once were.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
