      <description>&lt;p&gt;I remember when I was kid , when I was at most 15 years old, I created a weblog for myself.
I was so hyped over it, I was thinking, &lt;em&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to get so many viewers&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I didn&amp;rsquo;t. 🐏&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past-me would condemn me for not achieving that, but Present-me doesn&amp;rsquo;t even care, really, not in the slightest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is really weird how people change over the course of time, people can change so much, that they can become the opposite of what they once were.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, This is Yolowex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friends call me by many names, but my online friends,
mostly call me &lt;em&gt;Yolowex&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my first self-hosted blog, I am really excited, what am I going to write in it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to know about me, I am a guy in his mid-twentieth,
who codes to make a living (obviously), and is heavily unattracted to many things,
&lt;em&gt;SPECIALLY&lt;/em&gt;, forex trading and crypto investing (&lt;em&gt;uncapitalized on purpose&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
